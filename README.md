## My process
For this project, I used the VSCode extension Live Share to work on a project with a friend where we practiced building a project together.
We delegated tasks and worked on seperate sections of the code to practice merging them together for a final project. We also tried to each 
cover all aspects of the project to practice a variety of sections to code. We also built this using the Stack data structure as it was 
perfectly fiiting for the Tower of Hanoi game.
